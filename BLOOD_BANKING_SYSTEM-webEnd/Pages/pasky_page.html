        <h4>What are the eligibility criteria for donating blood at this hospital?</h4>
        <p4>"To donate blood, you must be at least 17 years old (or 16 with parental
          consent in some regions), weigh at least 110 pounds (50 kg), and be in good
          general health. You should not have donated blood in the last 56 days, and
          certain travel histories or medications might affect your eligibility!"</p4>

      <div>
        <h4>How can I check the availability of specific
          blood types in the hospital's blood bank?</h4>

        <p4>You can check the availability of specific blood types by accessing
          the hospital's blood bank inventory system, which provides real-time
          updates on the current stock levels of different blood types.</p4>

      <div>
        <h4>What tests are performed to screen donated blood for infectious diseases?</h4>
        <p4>Donated blood is screened for various infectious diseases,
          including HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis, and West Nile virus.
          The screening process involves multiple tests to ensure the safety
          and quality of the blood before it is used for transfusions.</p4>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>What are the emergency protocols for handling urgent blood transfusion requests?</h4>

        <p4>In case of an emergency, the hospital follows specific protocols
          to prioritize and expedite blood transfusion requests. This includes
          having a rapid response team, maintaining a reserve of universal donor
          blood (O-negative), and ensuring quick communication between departments
          to facilitate immediate transfusions.</p4>

      <div>
        <h4>How is the blood inventory managed and monitored to ensure adequate supply?</h4>

        <p4>The blood inventory is managed using an automated inventory management
          system that tracks blood donations, usage, and stock
          levels in real-time. The system generates alerts for low stock
          levels and helps in planning blood
          drives to maintain an adequate supply.</p4>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4> What measures are in place to ensure the safety and compatibility
          of blood transfusions for patients?</h4>

        <p4>To ensure patient safety, the hospital conducts thorough
          compatibility testing, including blood typing and crossmatching,
          before any transfusion. Additionally, strict protocols are followed
          for handling and storing blood products, and all transfusions are
          monitored closely for any adverse reactions.</p4>
